# 🐍 Snake Game with Hand Gesture Control  

A modern Snake Game controlled with **hand gestures** using the **TensorFlow Object Detection API**.  
No keyboard required – play by moving your hands in front of the camera!

Would you like me to also generate a **requirements.txt** (with TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, etc.) for this repo so users can set it up quickly?
